I was amazed after watching that video and immediately became a fan of yours. It also reminded me the time that my friend and I listened to Vocaloid music on Niconico in high school, and so I started to become a DD of Vtubers XD.<br>I love your streaming style and your taste in games. For me, your streaming and VOD are the best BGM for work because of the relaxing atmosphere and your beautiful speaking voice. What I love the most is the NIJIMilo IRL collab. Not only did it make me feel the warmth of NIJISANJI family, it also let me know that in the near future, I could meet my family and friends living abroad. Just like the name of Luxiem's debut song \"Hope in the Dark\", thank you for bringing so much positive energy in a time like this.<br>Normally, you are the one who gives us birthday blessings, and today, it's our turn to give you our blessings. Hope you have lots of presents, lots of cakes or whatever the heck you fancy. <br>HAPPY BIRTHDAY!"}};});
