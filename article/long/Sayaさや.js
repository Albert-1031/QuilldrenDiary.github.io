One night at that time, you saw the most beautiful night sky you have ever seen in your life. Since then, you have been looking forward to finding such beautiful scenery again. I don't know why, but the tone and expression of you telling this little story is deep in my heart, and since then,I always look up at the beautiful night sky and think, \"Such beauty matches the graceful Ike. It would be great if Ike could see this too...\" Hope you, who have been amazing since debut stream, will continue to exude your unique charm in the future! "}};});
